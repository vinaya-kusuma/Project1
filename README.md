Team Members (Group 6):
 Bryson Wersonke, Madhavi Pandey, Pallavi Tripathi, Ranjini Rao & Vinaya Kusuma
Project Description/outline
 In this project, we analyze the current and the projected employment distribution for the next 10 years. We study the impact of automation on various sectors and understand the fastest growing and declining occupations. This project analyses prospective employment for the sectors most affected by automation and seeks to predict job movement.
Research questions to answer:
1.	What is the current and projected employment distribution across various sectors/industries? 
2.	What is the distribution of the wages for different sectors? 
3.	Employment openings and average change
4.	What are the jobs that are affected the most due to automation?
5.	What are the fastest growing/declining occupations?
6.	What are the employment prospects for the job seekers who have lost their jobs due to automation?
7.	Map displaying the states with booming employment.
