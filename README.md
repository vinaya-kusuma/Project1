Project Proposal
Project Title: Impact of Automation on Occupations

Team Members (Group 6):
 Bryson Wersonke, Madhavi Pandey, Pallavi Tripathi, Ranjini Rao & Vinaya Kusuma
 
Project Description/outline:
In this project, we analyze the current and the projected employment distribution for the next 10 years. We study the impact of automation on various sectors  and understand the fastest growing and declining occupations. Additionally, we also evaluate impact of automation on jobs across US states. This project analyses prospective employment for the sectors most affected by automation and seeks to predict job movement.

Research questions to answer:
1.	What is the current and projected employment distribution across various sectors/industries? 
2.	What is the distribution of the wages for different sectors? 
3.	Employment openings and average change
4.	What are the jobs that are affected the most due to automation?
5.	What are the fastest growing/declining occupations?
6.	What are the employment prospects for the job seekers who have lost their jobs due to automation?
7.	What is the impact of automation across US states.
8.	What are the highly impacted jobs in certain US states?
