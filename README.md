# Project1

## Project Proposal
**Project Title:** Impact of Automation on Occupations in US

## Team Members (Group 6):
* Bryson Wersonke
* Madhavi Pandey
* Pallavi Tripathi
* Ranjini Rao
* Vinaya Kusuma
 
## Project Description/outline:
In this project, we analyze the current and the projected employment distribution for the next 10 years. We study the impact of automation on various sectors  and understand the fastest growing and declining occupations. Additionally, we also evaluate impact of automation on jobs across US states. This project analyses prospective employment for the sectors most affected by automation and seeks to predict job movement.

## Research questions to answer:
1.	*What is the current and projected employment distribution across various sectors/industries?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Occupation_Analysis.ipynb)*
2.	*What is the distribution of the wages for different sectors?* [Code Link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/rao/minor-fixes/Wages_distribution_Analysis.ipynb)*
3.	*Correlation between the job experience for declining jobs and automation probability?* [Code Link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/rao/minor-fixes/Wages_distribution_Analysis.ipynb)*
4.	*What are the jobs that are affected the most due to automation?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Occupation_Analysis.ipynb)*
5. *What is the impact of automation on different Ethnicities?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Ethnicity_Occupation_Analysis.ipynb)*
6.	*What are the fastest growing/declining occupations?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Occupation_Analysis.ipynb)*
7.	*What are the employment prospects for the job seekers who have lost their jobs due to automation?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Median_Wage_Education_Analysis.ipynb)*
8.	*What is the impact of automation across US states?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Automation_Analysis_by_state.ipynb)*
9.	*What are the highly impacted jobs in certain US states?* [Code link](https://github.com/vinaya-kusuma/Project1/blob/main/Automation_Analysis_by_state.ipynb)*

## Pre-requisites:
We have used plotly express library to plot US map with states in our code. Here is the command to install plotly express
```
conda install -c plotly plotly_express
```
```
conda install -c conda-forge python-kaleido
```
Here is the [link](https://pypi.org/project/plotly-express/) for more information on plotly-express.

8.  **Statewise Occupation data** [download link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vPgfSd1oOP8MAn52J7coPReTVi7V2ihl/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=116688671136343262834&rtpof=true&sd=true). This data is sourced from bls.gov. Size of data is 138 MBs and hence cannot be uploaded here. It needs to be downloaded and moved to Resources folder.
